# Blog Management and Subscription System

Welcome to the Blog Management and Subscription System! This is a Linux-based system for managing blogs, subscriptions, user preferences, and content moderation. It uses Bash scripts, YAML configuration files, and MySQL for data persistence, with fine-grained permissions via Linux ACLs (setfacl).

## System Overview

- **Purpose**: Allows users to subscribe to authors, authors to manage blogs, moderators to filter content, and admins to generate reports and manage users.
- **Key Features**:
  - User subscription to authors' exclusive content.
  - Blog creation, publishing, archiving, and deletion.
  - Content moderation using blacklists.
  - Personalized blog recommendations based on user preferences.
  - Admin reports on blog reads and categories.
- **Directory Structure**:
  - `/home/users/<username>`: User home directories with all_blogs and subscribed_blogs.
  - `/home/authors/<author>`: Author directories with blogs, public, and subscribers_only.
  - `/home/mods/<mod>`: Moderator directories with blacklist.txt and author symlinks.
  - `/scripts`: Contains all scripts and YAML configs (users.yaml, subscriptions.yaml, etc.).
  - `/scripts/reports`: Stores admin-generated reports.
